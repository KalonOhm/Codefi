1. data types are the kinds of information that the language is able to understand and use within statements and other processes. 
    in Javascript, they are "strings", numbers, Booleans, null, NaN, undefined, and complex data types like array, object, and function
2. Operators are used to mutate/change, compare, or evaluate data/values. +, -, *, /, <, >, ===, etc. 
3. if (condition is true), then (additional code in the tatement is ran.) If it wasn't true/fulfilled, then the statement is skipped. 
4. Loops are iterative sections of code that are run multiple times, often with changing variables. 
    They allow youto do the same process over several values in an array, list, or by increments 
    across a known or unknown number of items.
