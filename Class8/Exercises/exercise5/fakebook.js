/*Use the Observable pattern to update information on a given webpage.
Let's say you as the user are in a webpage. You have a navbar in which displays login. You see a list of user statuses that display their thoughts of a matter. Each status has a like button.
As a user, you cannot like a button until you are signed in. If you do like a button, it will present a modal that shows 'login'.
When the user clicks, login, present a fake login.
Once login, the navbar should display some sort of text as "Welcome!".
From there you should be able to like a user's post.*/
